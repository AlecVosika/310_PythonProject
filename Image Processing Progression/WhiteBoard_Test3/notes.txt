Change:
	I check for white before I check for black and I changed
	the value for white from anything greater than 225 to 200

Result:
	It worked much better and was actually able to give me an answer

Problem:
	1. Some sections of the black lines were converted to white.
	2. The end point was not correct due to the unwanted red pixels everywhere.
